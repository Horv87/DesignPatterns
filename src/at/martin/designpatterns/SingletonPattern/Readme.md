#Singleton Pattern

##About
A Singleton Pattern restricts the creation of an class to only one object.
This implementation is not thread safe.

More Information on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern).
##Advantages
 * Useful when only one instance of an class is needed.
 * Singleton has an Advantage over global variables as no namespace pollution is going on
 * Instantiation overhead is avoided (not wasting memory for a new object when you dont actually need one)
